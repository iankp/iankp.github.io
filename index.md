Hello, and welcome to my website!

<h1>About this Site</h1>
Here, I plan to keep a [blog](blog) in which I talk about some of the projects
that I have worked on in my spare time. There isn't much content there yet, but
my next entry will likely be about an STM32-based I/O board that I am presently
working on. The board has a keypad, 7-segment display, several LEDs, and
an STM32-L0. Although this is a relatively simple project, it will serve the
purpose of introducing me to the STM32 toolchain and KiCad (my previous
experience is with Altium Designer). I'll be able to use it as a starting point
for other STM32-based projects I have planned. Stay tuned!

<h1>About Me</h1>
In May 2021, I will graduate with a B.A.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at
the University of British Columbia.

More information about my work experience is available on my [LinkedIn
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iankelloughpollock). I have completed my
degree requirements and am currently available for employment.
